# Slide Structure & Hook Writing

## The 6-Slide Formula (EXACTLY 6 — TikTok minimum)

| Slide | Purpose | Text Style |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 | HOOK — stop the scroll | Relatable problem, full hook text |
| 2 | PROBLEM — amplify pain | Build tension |
| 3 | DISCOVERY — turning point | "So I tried this" / "Then I found..." |
| 4 | TRANSFORMATION 1 — first result | Reaction: "Wait... this actually looks good?" |
| 5 | TRANSFORMATION 2 — escalate | Reaction: "Okay I'm obsessed" |
| 6 | CTA — call to action | App name + "link in bio" |

**SAME subject, SAME angle, DIFFERENT styles across all 6 slides.**

## Proven Hook Formulas

### Tier 1: Person + Conflict → AI → Changed Mind (BEST)
- "I showed my mum what AI thinks our [room] should look like" (161K views)
- "My landlord said I can't change anything so I showed her this" (124K views)
- "My boyfriend said our flat looks like [insult] so I showed him"
- "My flatmate wouldn't believe this is the same room"

### Tier 2: Relatable Budget Pain
- "POV: You have good taste but no budget"
- "IKEA budget, designer taste"
- "I can't afford an interior designer so I tried AI"

### Tier 3: Curiosity / Self-Discovery
- "I've always wondered what I'd look like with..."
- "I had to see if it would even suit me"
- "Everyone's getting [thing] but would it suit MY face?"

### What DOESN'T Work
- Self-focused complaints without conflict: "My flat is ugly" (low views)
- Fear/insecurity hooks for beauty: "Am I ugly without..." (people scroll past)
- Price comparison without story: "$500 vs $5000" (needs character)

## Hook Adaptation by Category

### Home/Interior Apps
Replace [room] and [style] with user's app focus:
- "My [person] said our [room] looks like [insult]"
- "I showed my [person] what AI thinks our [room] should look like"
- "[Person] wouldn't let me redecorate until I showed them this"

### Beauty Apps
- "My [person] got [treatment] and now I can't stop thinking about it"
- "I've always had [feature] and never known what [change] would look like"
- "Everyone keeps asking if I got [treatment] done"

### Fitness Apps
- "My trainer said I'd never look like [goal]"
- "I showed my gym buddy what AI thinks I could look like in 6 months"

### Productivity Apps
- "My boss said my workflow is a mess so I showed her this"
- "I was spending 4 hours on [task] until I found this"

## Image Prompt Template

Write ONE base description, reuse across all 6 slides:

```
iPhone photo of a [CONTEXT]. [DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SUBJECT].
Shot from [CAMERA POSITION]. [SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURAL/PHYSICAL DETAILS].
Natural phone camera quality, realistic lighting. Portrait orientation.

[SLIDE-SPECIFIC STYLE CHANGES ONLY]
```

### What to Lock (same across all 6):
- Subject dimensions/features
- Camera angle/position
- Lighting direction
- Background elements
- Physical structure (windows, doors, body proportions)

### What Changes Per Slide (ONLY):
- Style/aesthetic
- Colors/textures
- Decor/accessories
- Expression (for faces)

## Caption Template

```
[hook matching slide 1] 😭 [2-3 sentences of relatable struggle].
So I found this app called [APP NAME] that [what it does in one sentence] -
you just [simple action] and it [result]. I tried [style 1] and [style 2]
and honestly?? [emotional reaction]. [funny/relatable closer] 
#[niche1] #[niche2] #[niche3] #[niche4] #fyp
```

Keep it conversational. Tell a mini-story. Mention the app naturally, not salesy.
